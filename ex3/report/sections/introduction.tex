\section{Introduction}
The main goal of this excercise was to implement a driver for Linux for the same gamepad used in the previous excercises\cite{ex1}\cite{ex2}.
The driver should have the features nessesary for using the gamepad in the game also developed for this excercise.

\subsection{The Game}
The choice of game was the classic, Pong.
Pong is one of the very first arcade video games ever made\cite{pong}.
The game is a simplified game of table tennis in two dimentions, as seen from the top.
See Figure \ref{pong} for a illustration.
It is a competitive game where two players use a pad on the edge of the screen to knock a ball past the oponents pad.
