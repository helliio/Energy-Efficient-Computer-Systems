\section{Abstract}
The objective of this exercise is to give a better understanding of linux device drivers. This was done by developing a black and white version of the classic game Pong\cite{pong}. The game was controlled by the gamepad used in previous exercises\cite{ex1}\cite{ex2}.
\\ \\
To be able to interact with the gamepad a device driver was implemented. This device driver is dependent on the hardware of the ARM Cortex-M3 and is Linux-spesific. It works as a program that operates the interaction between the and the software on the ARM Cortex-M3 and the gamepad.
