\subsection{Energy efficency}
After implementing Pong it was clear that it was hard to do any power optimasations. This is because the game need to be updated on every clock cycle, making time and button interrupts redundent. If a menu had been made, it would have been easy to demonstrate power consumtion using button interupts.

\subsection{Sound}
Sound is not an essential part of Pong. As an implementation of using sound on the chip was shown in exercise 2 \cite{ex2} it was decided not to use time on implementing it in this exercise. The extra time was rather used on improving the quality of the drivers.
