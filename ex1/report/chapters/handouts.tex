\section{Handed-out Materials}
The handed-out framework comes with a convenient makefile.
The makefile had targets for building the file for uploading, the ELF file used with GDB and for actually uploading the code to the microcontroller.

To produce the binary, the makefile assembles the file \emph{ex1.s}, invokes the linker with the handed-out linker script, and extracts the linked object from the generated ELF file.

A skeleton \emph{ex1.s} was provided, as well as a file containing the adresses of useful memory registers on the microcontroller.
