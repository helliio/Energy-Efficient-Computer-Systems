\section{Testing and results}
No formal testing was preformed as the code was clear and it was easy to maintain control over what the code did.
Ad-hoc testing was conducted when applicable to supplement this.

To establish a baseline for energy usage, a simple branch-to-self looping program was used.
The loop was modified to reflect the buttons pressed on the LEDs.
In another interation, the code was modified to use interupts.
The power consuption had an avarage of \SI{3.59}{\milli\ampere} while using only looping without interupts. 
When using interupt for the GPIO handler without using any sleep modes, the power consuption fell by around 4\% to \SI{3.44}{\milli\ampere}.
To reduce the power consuption further normal sleep was introduced.
The result of this was as little as \SI{1.25}{\milli\ampere}, or down another 64\%.
The last test was preformed with deep sleep.
The power consumption was then at \SI{1.7}{\micro\ampere}.
A great reduction.
As this was a simple demo there wasn't any obvious disadvantages by using deepsleep while the benefits was enourmous.
