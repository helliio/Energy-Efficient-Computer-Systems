\section{Development}
The development was carried out in natural stages of adding complexity.

\subsection{Lighting the LEDs}
The first course of action was to allow the program to control the LEDs.
This allows for some rudimentary output, and is a nessesary first step to complete the assignment.

The EFM32GG has external controllers memory mapped.
One of them is a GPIO-controller.
At startup, to save power, the external controllers are not clocked.
As such it is not possible to comunicate with the controller.
Thus before the GPIO-controller can be configured, the CMU must be set to enable the HFPERCLK for the GPIO-controller.
This is done by setting bit 13 in the CMU\_HFPERCLKEN0 register.
