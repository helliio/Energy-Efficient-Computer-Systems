\section{Introduction}
Energy efficient programming is a very important field within computer science due to the expanding market of battery dependent devices.
When facing these situations, programming in an energy effiecient manner is important.
This would in turn increase the battery life of portable devices.

Excercise 1 in TDT4258 required the team to write a program in assembly that would allow the user to use the gamepad buttons to control the LEDs on the gamepad.
Among the learning outcomes where \emph{interrupt handling} and \emph{simple energy optimiztions}.
With these lenient requirements, the team decided that a simple program would suffice, and focus should be put on gaining the learning outcome of the excercise.
This report outlines what the team learned, and how the program was developed.
