\section{DAC}
DAC or the Digital to Analog Converter is used to generate analouge singnals based on the digital values it receves.
The DAC is connected to the 3.5mm headphone jack so that we could play the sound generated.
Initialising the DAC for inputs is quite simple.
Within the \emph{setup.c} file we have the \emph{setupDAC} function.

\begin{minted}{objdump}
void setupDAC()
{
    *CMU_HFPERCLKEN0    |=  1 << 17;
    *DAC0_CTRL          =   0x50010;
    *DAC0_CH0CTRL       =   1;
    *DAC0_CH1CTRL       =   1;
}
\end{minted}

This sets the DAC to get inputs from the \emph{DAC0_CH0DATA} and the \emph{DAC0_CH1DATA} registers.
As this continous steram of data is converteed to a analouge signal by teh DAC, a sound waves would be generated from the speakers connected to the jack.
