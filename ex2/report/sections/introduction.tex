\section{Introduction}
Excercise 2 in TDT4258 required the team to use the C programming language to accept input from buttons and control LEDs on a gamepad and use the DAC on the developmen board to produce sound.
Making use of LEDs and buttons was already covered in the first excercise of the course, where the team implemented this functionality in assembly, and so consisted of recreating it in low-level C code.
