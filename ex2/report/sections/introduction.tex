\section{Introduction}
This Excercise required the team to use the C programming language to accept input from buttons and control LEDs on a gamepad and use the DAC on the developmen board to produce sound.
Making use of LEDs and buttons was already covered in the first excercise of the course, where the team implemented this functionality in assembly\cite{report}, and so consisted of recreating it in low-level C code.
The solution must be able to make at least three different sound effects. It should also play a start up melody which can be played when the game begins\cite[p. 37]{Compendium}.

We wanted to make an instrument instead of just making this groundwork for the next exercise. After boot the melody called ``Lisa gikk til skolen'' was played slowly. It was also possible to play all tones in a major. With over eight notes the requirement with three different sounds were met. The design can easily be expanded to make more game-suited sounds for the next exercise.
