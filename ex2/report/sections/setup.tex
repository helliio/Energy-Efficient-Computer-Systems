\section{Setup}
Instead of using the handout setup, all of the setup functions has been collected into one single file \emph{setup.c}.
As this gives a better and more readable code structure.
The functions \emph{setupDAC}, \emph{setupNVIC}, \emph{setupGPIO} and \emph{setupTimer} are gathered into one single file.
All of theses functions would be called from the \emph{main(void)} function in the \emph{ex2.c} file.
