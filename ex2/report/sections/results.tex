\section{Results}
Different power settings was tested for their energy efficiency.
The tests are preformed in combinations of turning DAC off when not in use and the deep sleep mode.
The results are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Both DAC off setting and Deep sleep when idling: 1.0uA
  \item Both DAC off setting and Deep sleep when a key is pressed: 2.2mA
  \item Deep sleep when idling: 214uA
  \item Deep sleep when a key is pressed: 2.2mA
  \item DAC off setting when idling: 1.6mA
  \item DAC off setting when a key is pressed: 2.2mA
  \item No power saving implemented when idling: 2.1mA
  \item No power saving implemented when a key is pressed: 2.2mA
\end{itemize}

As the results show, both the deep sleep mode and turning off the DAC when not in use has a huge impact on the power consumption.
