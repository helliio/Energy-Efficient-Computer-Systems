\subsection{Usage of Interrupts}
Whenever specific hardware events occur, the microcontroller can be configured to set aside what is's doing and handle it immediately.
As it will be notified as nessesary, these events allow the microcontroller to avoid polling values peridically, and instead do something else or sleep to save power.

The solution makes use of interrupts in both of these ways.
Whenever possible, the microcontroller disables as many functions as possible, goest to sleep and waits for an interrupt for a button press from the GPIO.
Interruprs are also made use of to do work periodically on presice intervals be reacting to timer events.

The concrete procedure for setting up interrupts on the EFM-32GG is explained in the report for excercise 1\cite{report}.
The use of interrupt handlers in C-code was already set up in the support files, and handlers with the correct synbols would by automatically linked as intended with the runtime in libefm32gg.a.
