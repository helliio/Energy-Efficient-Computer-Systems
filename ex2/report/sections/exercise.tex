\section{Interpretation of the Exercise}
The exercise was to write a C program that runs directly on the development board and which plays different sound effects when different buttons are pressed. The solution must be able to make at least three different sound effects. It should also play a start up melody which can be played when the game begins.

We wanted to make an instrument instead of just making this groundwork for the next exercise. After boot the melody called “Lisa gikk til skolen” is played slowly. It is also possible to play all tones in C major. With over eight notes the requirement with three different sounds are met. The design can easily be expanded to make more game-suited sounds for the next exercise.
