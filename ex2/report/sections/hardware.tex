\section{Hardware}
The game pad comprises of eight buttons and eight LEDs.
The buttons, labeled \emph{SW1} through \emph{SW8}, connect ground and pins 0--7 on port C.
The LEDs, labeled \emph{D1} though \emph{D8}, connect VCC to pins 8--15 on port A.
This means that both the buttons and the LEDs are active-low, and there will be a need to enable the internal pull-up resistor on the inputs.

There is also a jumper controlling whether the power draw of the LEDs is part of the power measurement by changing the power source.
Since the power draw of the LEDs is not interesting, the jumper was kept in the lower setting.
The dev board has a analogue 3.5 mm headphone jack out put which can be connected to a headset for sound output.
